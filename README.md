## Venues near me

It's a basic web app that uses Forsquare API to get a list of venues near the user location.
The venues are displayed on the map using the Google Maps API.

No framweorks are used just the JS DOM for displaying data in HTML. Can be adjusted to use any other JS frameworks.

Not using ES6, the app it's using protoptye based inheritance, fully flegged ES5 (the last of the mohicans). 

### Basic usage:
 	- git clone https://github.com/IonutC/venues-near-me 
	- cd venues-near-me
	- yarn install

---

### Starting a dev server:
	- cd venues-near-me
	- yarn serve
	- go to http://localhost:8080

---

### Bulding the project JS and CSS bundles:
	- yarn build
	- cd public
	- ls -la

---

There are still some things misssing.
